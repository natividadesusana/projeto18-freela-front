## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

Travel Agency is a small travel agency that aims to make life easier for our customers, providing information about tickets and accommodation for the best destinations.

The goal was to practice creating a website that provides a digital experience for users. The site does not sell tickets and accommodation, it only lists the available options so that customers can assemble their ideal trip. It is not necessary to have an account to access the information. When selecting a city, separate ticket and accommodation options will be displayed in different areas of the site.

I chose to use React.js as one of the most popular web development libraries today, providing a scalable and maintainable framework for building modern web applications. I used React Router to manage the application's routes. Axios was used to make API calls and search for information about tickets, accommodations and cities. I used Styled-Components to create the user interface and provide a nice and intuitive experience for users.
